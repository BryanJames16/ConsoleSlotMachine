# Console Slot Machine

An incredibly tiny pet project to create console based slot machine. Less than 500kb in size. Written in C.

This has been developed and compiled in Orwell's version of Dev-C++. I would highly suggest to use and compile it using the mentioned software.

## Using

Run the application via UI or shell. You can also configure luck, speed, and lights using "Machine Configuration" application.
